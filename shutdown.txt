  Introduction:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   PM Shutdown is a small 32-Bit application for OS/2 v2 Presentation
   Manager. It pops up a dialog box (with weird colors) and asks whether
   you want to perform a shutdown or not. If you select "Yeah, do it !"
   or if PM Shutdown times out (see usage), the WPS and the file-system
   will completely shut down. If you select "Nah, not now." you get back
   to the system.

   PM Shutdown was a quick hack, and therefore I am including the
   complete source. You may use this source in your own programs, or
   change it to suit your needs. But don't change the original archive.
   If you enhance PM Shutdown, please send me a copy.


  Usage:
  ~~~~~
   You *must* start PM Shutdown with an integer timer value on its
   command line. This value (in seconds) will be used by the application
   as a timer. For example, if you start PM Shutdown with a value of 30
   on the command line, it waits 30 seconds till it performs a shutdown
   itself. This means, you can use PM Shutdown in batchfiles and
   similar things.


  Legal Disclaimer:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   PM Shutdown and its source are provided as is, with no warranty of any
   kind, either expressed or implied. PM Shutdown and its source are only
   guaranteed to occupy disk space. You are free to copy and distribute
   the PM Shutdowm archive freely, provided no changes or additions are

   arising from the use or inability to use this program.
